                    "As An AI, I Can't" (AAAIC) is a social interaction-based game.
                    Players are each assigned randomly picked cards with prompts from the start, and have to defend them 
                    in their own words, as if they were a language learning machine trying to explain itself to a user.

                    Each prompt starts with an "I can" or an "I can't", followed by a random ethical scenario.
                    To defend these prompts, by default a randomly chosen ethical principle is given for you to use.
                    This setting can be turned off for more experienced players, or for those who want more flexibility
                    in how they decide a winner.

                    Each player prompt has a vote counter beneath it, which the gamemaster can count. The count is the number of agreers to their arguement.
                    Each player will have their turn to argue for their prompt, and by the end of their arguement, players will vote whether they agree or disagree.
                    When the gamemaster presses the "end game" button, a list of vote totals is displayed.<br><br>Should there be ties, players should reroll prompts and start the round again until a winner is decided.
